# Cornerston Clothing Items

An ox inventory based script to make clothing an item. Development and testing was done using Illinieum Appearance. 

The script uses meta data and the Ox inventory clothing item in order to create as many custom clothing items as you woould like. 

To properly use this script you will want to blacklist the clothign items from the clothing menu so they can only be used as an item.
